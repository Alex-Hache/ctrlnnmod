'''
    This module implements several parameterizations for discrete neural state-space models
    it includes :
        - Alpha stable linear models
        - L2 gain bounded linear models -- H inifinty norm
        - QSR dissipative linear models including :
            - L2 gain bounded
        - H2 gain
        - Incrementally QSR dissipative models including :
            - Incremental L2 gain bounded
            - Incrementally input passive
            - Incrementally output passive
